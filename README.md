# Find_Detective
This is a program that helps you find the word "detective" in text. The important thing is you should find it whether any of the letters or all of the letters are capital or not. 

**QUESTÄ°ON TEXT**
You are an intern at the National Security Agency (NSA), and you have been put in charge of reading messages for potentially seditious content. More particularly, you are given a readout of N (1 < 100) characters, and you must mark this message with the first occurence of the string "detective", in any combination of lowercase and uppercase letters. Of course, such deskwork is beneath you, so write a program to do it while you can leave to do more important things (like catching up on sleep).
